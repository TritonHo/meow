/*
	demo_admin is the database owner.
	It owns all objects(table, trigger, etc) in the database.
	Usually, it should be used ONLY when DBA wants to change the database schema.

	demo_user is the account used by the golang executable.
	Thus, it is NOT allowed to create / change / any object in database.
	For normal table, only CURD privilege is granted, truncate table should NOT be granted.
	For audit table, no privilege should be granted.

	demo_readonly is used during debugging.
	Trusted software developer will use this account to view the data in production database directly.
	Thus it should have select privilege.
